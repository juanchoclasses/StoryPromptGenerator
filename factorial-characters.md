# Factorial Factory Characters

## Manager Four (Level 4 Manager)
**Name:** Manager Four (or "Quattro")

**Description:**
A tall, enthusiastic character wearing a hard hat shaped like the number "4" with a factorial symbol (!) on top. She has four arms (because she's "four"!), each holding different tools: a speaking tube, a multiplication wrench, an order clipboard, and a celebration banner. Her vest is covered in badges showing "4×3×2×1" and she wears glasses shaped like multiplication signs. Her expression is eager and leadership-oriented—she starts the whole process! Her body is slightly squared (like the number 4) but bouncy and energetic. She's colored in bold ruby red with gold accents.

**Role:** The initiator who receives the original problem and delegates to Level 3.

## Manager Three (Level 3 Manager)
**Name:** Manager Three (or "Trina")

**Description:**
A medium-height character with three ponytails that bounce when she moves, each ponytail decorated with a small gear. Her hard hat is shaped like the number "3" and glows softly. She has three eyes arranged in a triangle on her face (whimsical style—not creepy!), allowing her to watch three directions at once: above (Level 4), her own work, and below (Level 2). She wears a jumpsuit with three pockets and carries a three-pronged tool for managing her multiplication machine. Her body has gentle curves like the number 3. She's colored in emerald green with silver accents. She's focused and efficient, like a middle manager keeping the chain going.

**Role:** The middle delegator who passes the request down and relays the answer back up.

## Manager Two (Level 2 Manager)
**Name:** Manager Two (or "Deuce")

**Description:**
A character with a body shaped like two stacked circles (like a snowman but only two parts), making him literally look like the number "2". His hard hat has two antennae with small lights on top. He has two tools always in hand: a speaking horn and a multiplication calculator. His outfit is a two-tone uniform: half sapphire blue, half sky blue, split down the middle. He wears goggles with two lenses that can swivel independently. His expression is friendly and methodical—he knows he's close to the base case and maintains steady focus. He has two mechanical hands that can spin independently like gears.

**Role:** The penultimate delegator who calls the base case and begins the multiplication chain going back up.

## Manager One (Level 1 Manager - The Base Case!)
**Name:** Manager One (or "Unity")

**Description:**
A small but MIGHTY character who stands on a glowing pedestal, making her seem more important than her size suggests. She's shaped like the number "1"—tall, thin, and perfectly straight, but with a large round head and a big smile. She wears a golden crown-shaped hard hat with "BASE CASE" written on it. Unlike the other managers, she has a special glowing aura because she's the ONLY one who can answer without help. Her outfit is completely golden with amethyst purple accents. She carries a stamp that says "1! = 1" which she uses with great pride and authority. She has one big tool belt with one perfect tool. Her expression is confident and foundational—she KNOWS she's essential! Single antenna on her hat glows like a lighthouse.

**Role:** The base case who can answer immediately without recursion—the foundation of the entire calculation!

## The Number Messengers (Supporting Characters)
**Name:** The Number Sprites

**Description:**
Small, floating helpers that carry the answers between levels. Each sprite looks like its number (a "1" sprite, a "2" sprite, a "6" sprite, and a "24" sprite), but with tiny wings, smiling faces, and sparkle trails. They're translucent and glow in their respective colors. The "1" sprite is tiny and golden. The "2" sprite is slightly bigger. The "6" sprite is medium-sized. The "24" sprite is the largest and most elaborate, covered in celebration sparkles. They don't speak but communicate through cheerful chimes and musical tones.

**Role:** Visual representations of the values being passed up through the recursive return chain.

## The Multiplication Machines (Animated Objects)
**Name:** The Calc-U-Trons

**Description:**
Each level has its own personality-filled multiplication machine (not quite characters, but animated and expressive). They have faces made of dials and displays, arms made of conveyor belts, and they light up and make happy whirring sounds when calculating. Each machine is decorated with its level's number and has a personality matching its manager—the Level 4 machine is enthusiastic and hasty, Level 3's is efficient and precise, Level 2's is steady and methodical, and Level 1's is simple but proud, with a sign that says "NO MULTIPLICATION NEEDED - BASE CASE!"

**Role:** The tools each manager uses to perform their multiplication step.

## The Factory Foreman (Narrator/Guide)
**Name:** Professor Factorial (or "Prof F")

**Description:**
A wise, elderly character with a beard shaped like a factorial symbol (!). Wears a top hat with the recursive formula "n! = n × (n-1)!" written around the brim. Has a pocket watch that runs backwards and forwards simultaneously. Carries a pointer shaped like an arrow (→) to show the flow of recursion. Dressed in a professorial coat covered in mathematical patches and medals. Has kind, twinkling eyes behind spiral-shaped spectacles. Sometimes appears at different levels, sometimes shows up in the margins—a guide who helps explain what's happening.

**Role:** The narrator/guide who can appear in scenes to help explain the recursive process to the audience.
