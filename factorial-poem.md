# The Factorial Factory: Calculating 4!

## Introduction

Welcome, friends, to the Factorial Factory floor,
Where numbers multiply and then multiply some more!
We'll calculate four-factorial today,
And watch recursion work in a magical way!

## Stanza 1: The Order Arrives (4!)

The order comes in: "Calculate four!"
The manager says, "I can't do this alone, that's for sure!
Four-factorial means four times three-factorial, you see,
So I'll call the next floor down and wait patiently!"

## Stanza 2: Level 3 Gets the Call (3!)

Down on Level Three, a new manager appears,
"Calculate three-factorial!" rings in her ears.
But three times two-factorial is what she must find,
So she calls Level Two—another floor to unwind!

## Stanza 3: Level 2 Takes Over (2!)

Level Two springs to life with a whirr and a clank,
The manager says, "Two-factorial? I need a lower rank!"
"Two times one-factorial," he carefully states,
And calls Level One while his answer awaits!

## Stanza 4: Level 1 Receives the Request (1!)

Down at Level One, the call comes through clear,
"We need one-factorial!" the message appears.
The manager grins—this is easy to do,
"One-factorial equals one—that's always true!"

## Stanza 5: The Base Case! (1! = 1)

"I don't need to call anyone else!" she exclaims with delight,
"One-factorial is one—I can answer outright!"
The base case is reached, the foundation is laid,
And now the answers flow back—the calls will be repaid!

## Stanza 6: Level 2 Gets Its Answer (2! = 2×1)

The answer "ONE" travels up to Level Two,
The manager multiplies: "Two times one—I'm through!"
"Two-factorial equals TWO!" he announces with pride,
And sends this result to Level Three, up the side!

## Stanza 7: Level 3 Completes (3! = 3×2)

Level Three receives "TWO" with a cheerful chime,
The manager calculates: "Three times two—it's time!"
"Three-factorial equals SIX!" she declares with glee,
And shoots the answer upward to Level Four, you see!

## Stanza 8: Level 4 Finishes (4! = 4×6)

The top floor receives "SIX"—the wait is done!
The manager multiplies: "Four times six—we've won!"
"Four-factorial equals TWENTY-FOUR!" rings through the air,
The order's complete! Success everywhere!

## Conclusion

From four to three to two to one we descended,
Then back up we climbed until multiplication ended.
That's recursion's magic—break problems down small,
Then build the answer back up through levels that call!
Each floor does its part, then waits for the rest,
And together they solve it—recursion at its best!
