# Factorial Factory Scenes

## Scene 1: The Order Arrives
**Title:** The Order Arrives at Level 4

**Description:**
The top floor of the Factorial Factory. A large "4!" order ticket floats down from a pneumatic tube into the hands of Manager Four. The room is bright and busy, with gears labeled "4" spinning slowly, waiting for their answer. A large multiplication board shows "4 × ?" with a question mark glowing. A speaking tube extends downward through the floor, and Manager Four is leaning over it, calling down to Level 3. The atmosphere is one of anticipation—work has just begun!

## Scene 2: Level 3 Springs to Life
**Title:** Level 3 Receives the Call

**Description:**
Level 3 of the factory, positioned one floor below Level 4. Manager Three is catching the message coming up through a speaking tube from below, while simultaneously listening to a speaking tube from Level 4 above. The room is decorated with gears showing "3" and multiplication tables on the walls. A conveyor belt labeled "3 × ?" waits to move. Manager Three is pointing downward to Level 2, ready to pass along her own question. The space shows the middle of the recursive chain—receiving from above, delegating below.

## Scene 3: Level 2 Gets to Work
**Title:** Level 2 Takes the Request

**Description:**
Level 2 of the factory, two floors below the top. Manager Two is at his workstation, which features prominent gears labeled "2" and a multiplication machine showing "2 × ?". He's speaking into a tube that descends to Level 1. The room has two speaking tubes—one coming from Level 3 above, one going to Level 1 below. Conveyor belts are paused, waiting for the answer from below. The factory machinery is elaborate but patient, showing how each level depends on the next.

## Scene 4: Level 1 Ready to Solve
**Title:** Level 1 Receives the Final Call

**Description:**
Level 1 of the factory—the deepest floor with a special golden glow. Manager One is at her station, which is simpler but more important than the others. A large sign reads "BASE CASE - 1! = 1" in glowing letters. Unlike other levels, this floor has NO speaking tube going downward—this is where the recursion stops! The machinery here is ready to produce the answer immediately. The room has a foundational feeling, like the bedrock of the factory.

## Scene 5: The Base Case Celebration
**Title:** The Base Case - Success!

**Description:**
Still on Level 1, but now Manager One is celebrating! She's holding up a glowing number "1" that she's just created. Sparkles of "completion dust" fill the air. The machinery around her is lit up with success lights. She's putting the number "1" into an "ANSWER RETURN" tube that will send it upward to Level 2. This is the turning point—the only level that can answer without help. The mood is triumphant and foundational.

## Scene 6: Level 2 Multiplies
**Title:** Level 2 Completes the Calculation

**Description:**
Back on Level 2. The number "1" has just arrived via the return tube from Level 1 below. Manager Two is at his multiplication machine, placing the "1" next to a "2" on the conveyor belt. The machine shows "2 × 1 = 2" in glowing numbers. The gears are turning actively now, and a new glowing "2" is being created. Manager Two is preparing to send this "2" up to Level 3 through the upward return tube. The atmosphere shows progress and momentum building.

## Scene 7: Level 3 Gets Her Answer
**Title:** Level 3 Multiplies and Passes Up

**Description:**
Level 3 is now active and calculating. Manager Three has received the glowing "2" from below and is running it through her multiplication machine. The display shows "3 × 2 = 6" in bright, cheerful numbers. A large glowing "6" is being produced on her conveyor belt. She's excitedly preparing to send this result upward to Level 4 through the return tube. The factory machinery is whirring with purpose. The recursive chain is nearly complete!

## Scene 8: Level 4 - The Final Answer!
**Title:** Level 4 Completes the Order

**Description:**
The top floor again—but now it's a celebration! Manager Four has received the glowing "6" from Level 3 below. His multiplication machine shows "4 × 6 = 24" in brilliant, sparkling numbers. A huge glowing "24" sits on the completion platform. Factory lights are flashing with success, confetti of numbers falls from the ceiling, and the original order ticket now reads "4! = 24 ✓ COMPLETE!" Manager Four is triumphantly holding up the final answer. All four levels can be glimpsed in the background, connected by glowing tubes showing how the answer traveled back up.

## Scene 9: The Complete Factory View
**Title:** Recursion Complete - All Levels Together

**Description:**
A cutaway view showing all four levels of the Factorial Factory simultaneously. Level 4 at the top (with "24"), Level 3 below it (with "6"), Level 2 below that (with "2"), and Level 1 at the bottom (with "1"). Glowing arrows show the path DOWN through the levels (4→3→2→1) and then back UP with answers (1→2→6→24). All four managers are visible at their stations, connected by speaking tubes and return tubes. The scene illustrates the complete recursive journey—down to the base case, then back up with solutions. It's a celebration of how all the pieces work together!
