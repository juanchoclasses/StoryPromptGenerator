    "title": "AI Diversity: Beyond the Majority",
    "backgroundSetup": "A sophisticated classroom called The Pattern Library, where massive data walls display flowing streams of information representing how AI learns from the world. Professor Bethany, sharp and professional in her tailored business suit with a distinctive purple-streaked bob, teaches students about the hidden biases in artificial intelligence. The room has elegant Display Screens showing training data sets, a central Pattern Recognition Engine that visualizes how AI finds commonalities, and a Diversity Monitor that highlights who gets included and excluded. Holographic projections show both successful and failed AI systems, demonstrating the real-world impact of biased training. IMPORTANT: All characters (Professor Bethany and students) should be positioned in the BOTTOM HALF of the image, with the data walls, Pattern Recognition Engine, Display Screens, and visual demonstrations in the top half.",

      "description": "A sharp, professional woman with an air of serious authority balanced by a subtle cheeky wit that emerges when making important points. She wears impeccably tailored business suits in charcoal gray or navy blue, paired with crisp white blouses and elegant low heels. Her bob haircut is precisely cut, jet black with bold purple streaks on one side that hint at her creative thinking and willingness to challenge conventions. She adjusts her thin-framed glasses when examining data and gestures with controlled, purposeful movements. Her expression is thoughtful and penetrating, but a slight smirk plays at her lips when revealing surprising truths about AI systems."

They wear an oversized, striped scarf that wraps around them multiple times, ending in a tassel that bounces as they nod vigorously. Their eyes are wide and perpetually amazed, and they often have a tiny, wobbly pencil clutched in a three-fingered hand, ready to scribble notes."

They have enormous, floppy ears that droop when they're confused and perk up when they understand. Their smile is wide and stretches almost ear to ear, and they often emit soft, bubbling giggles as they ponder concepts. They wear pants that are far too short, revealing long, segmented legs that end in enormous, flat feet."

Their hair is a burst of spiky yellow and orange, standing straight up as if charged with static. They have four small, quick-moving arms, each ending in a suction cup, and their large, round eyes dart around, taking everything in. They have no discernible mouth but communicate through a series of enthusiastic 'boings' and 'zings'"

They carry a small, portable periscope that they often peer through, even in class. They rarely speak, but when they do, it's in a gentle, melodious hum, and they often sketch intricate diagrams in a tiny notebook."

Her expression is both serious and warm, her purple-streaked bob framing her face as she delivers the final lesson. She removes her glasses—a rare gesture—and speaks directly from the heart. The Data Walls, Pattern Recognition Engine, and Diversity Monitor all glow harmoniously, showing what's possible. Student Eager Noodler's antennae stand tall with determination. This isn't just a technical problem—it's a moral imperative. Professor Bethany's cheeky side emerges one last time: 'Build AI that sees everyone, or don't build it at all.'",
