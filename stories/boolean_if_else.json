His spectacles are shaped like parentheses, and he carries a magical pointer that draws glowing paths in the air. His hat is a stack of nested if-statements, and his expression is always encouraging and thoughtful. He moves with deliberate, measured steps, pausing at decision points to let students think."

They wear an oversized, striped scarf that wraps around them multiple times, ending in a tassel that bounces as they nod vigorously. Their eyes are wide and perpetually amazed, and they often have a tiny, wobbly pencil clutched in a three-fingered hand, ready to scribble notes."

They have enormous, floppy ears that droop when they're confused and perk up when they understand. Their smile is wide and stretches almost ear to ear, and they often emit soft, bubbling giggles as they ponder concepts. They wear pants that are far too short, revealing long, segmented legs that end in enormous, flat feet."

They have four small, quick-moving arms, each ending in a suction cup, and their large, round eyes dart around, taking everything in. They have no discernible mouth but communicate through a series of enthusiastic 'boings' and 'zings'"

They carry a small, portable periscope that they often peer through, even in class. They rarely speak, but when they do, it's in a gentle, melodious hum, and they often sketch intricate diagrams in a tiny notebook."
