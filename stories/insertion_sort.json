    "backgroundSetup": "The Card Hall, a magical classroom where sorting happens like organizing playing cards. The room features a large table with a sorted section on the left and an unsorted pile on the right. As each card is picked up, it finds its proper place in the sorted section by sliding past cards until it reaches the correct position. Glowing arrows show where each card needs to go, and the walls display examples of partially sorted sequences. Professor Richard teaches here, demonstrating how to build a sorted list one element at a time with patience and precision. IMPORTANT: All characters (Professor Richard and students) should be positioned in the BOTTOM HALF of the image, with the code panels, sorting table, and visual demonstrations in the top half.",

He wears a vest covered in ascending number sequences and carries a conductor's baton that he waves to orchestrate the sorting dance. His bow tie spins when numbers swap correctly, and his shoes squeak in rhythm with the comparisons. He has a booming, encouraging voice and gestures grandly to emphasize each step of the algorithm. His pockets are filled with colored markers to draw swap arrows, and he often snaps his fingers to mark the beat of the sorting rhythm."

They wear an oversized, striped scarf that wraps around them multiple times, ending in a tassel that bounces as they nod vigorously. Their eyes are wide and perpetually amazed, and they often have a tiny, wobbly pencil clutched in a three-fingered hand, ready to scribble notes."

They have enormous, floppy ears that droop when they're confused and perk up when they understand. Their smile is wide and stretches almost ear to ear, and they often emit soft, bubbling giggles as they ponder concepts. They wear pants that are far too short, revealing long, segmented legs that end in enormous, flat feet."

They have four small, quick-moving arms, each ending in a suction cup, and their large, round eyes dart around, taking everything in. They have no discernible mouth but communicate through a series of enthusiastic 'boings' and 'zings'"

They carry a small, portable periscope that they often peer through, even in class. They rarely speak, but when they do, it's in a gentle, melodious hum, and they often sketch intricate diagrams in a tiny notebook."
