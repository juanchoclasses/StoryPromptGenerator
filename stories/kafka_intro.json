    "backgroundSetup": "A bustling, energetic plaza called The Stream Garden, where messages flow like water through interconnected channels and pools. Crystal-clear streams represent data flowing from producers to consumers, with a magnificent central Message Hub that buffers and organizes everything. Professor Sparkly Yvonne, ever-energetic in her tie-dyed shirts, teaches students how Kafka decouples systems by creating a buffering layer between services. Glowing message bubbles float through transparent pipes, waiting in shimmering pools before being consumed. The plaza has Topic Fountains that spray organized streams of data, and Consumer Stations where different services drink from the streams independently. IMPORTANT: All characters (Professor Sparkly Yvonne and students) should be positioned in the BOTTOM HALF of the image, with the message streams, Topic Fountains, Message Hub, and visual demonstrations in the top half.",

She wears colorful tie-dyed shirts in swirling patterns of purple, blue, and green, paired with comfortable denim shorts and well-worn hiking boots. Her silver-streaked hair is pulled back in a practical ponytail that bounces as she dashes from student to student. She always wears a vintage backpack covered in coding stickers and conference pins, and she gestures animatedly as she explains concepts. Her eyes sparkle with enthusiasm, and she often jogs in place while teaching, unable to contain her kinetic energy."

She emphasizes how the buffering layer is Kafka's superpower—it absorbs speed differences, provides reliability through persistence, enables replay, and completely decouples producers from consumers. The Buffer Pool Monitor displays a beautiful visualization of balanced load. Student Eager Noodler's antennae reach toward each other forming a heart shape, student Thoughtful Giggler giggles contentedly, Student Zippy Zapper performs a celebratory zing, and Student Quiet observer hums a satisfied melody. The entire Stream Garden glows with the beauty of well-architected decoupling.",
