She wears sturdy construction overalls in navy blue over a gray work shirt, steel-toed boots, and always carries a clipboard with her detailed to-do list. Her expression is focused and serious, with sharp eyes that miss nothing on the construction site. She has a no-nonsense demeanor but shows pride in the project.

He wears a faded plaid flannel shirt, work jeans with a leather tool belt, and scuffed work boots covered in concrete dust. His gray-streaked beard is short and practical. He's all business—no small talk, just efficient movement and expert craftsmanship. His face rarely shows emotion, but his work speaks volumes about his skill and dedication."

He approaches construction work with the same dedication he brings to his training, lifting materials with proper form and following instructions precisely. His face shows youthful determination and respect for the process."
