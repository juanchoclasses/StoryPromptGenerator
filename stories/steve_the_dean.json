The tower has meeting rooms at every level - the Grand Conference Hall for government mucky mucks, faculty lounges for professors, student commons for learners, and Steve's office at the top where he coordinates it all.",

      "description": "A distinguished, purposeful administrator with silver-streaked hair combed precisely to the side. He wears impeccably tailored suits with a different colored pocket square each day - today's is royal blue. His glasses are frameless and modern, and he carries a tablet that displays campus schedules, facility maps, and student enrollment data. Despite his formal appearance, his eyes are warm and he greets everyone by name. He moves with determined efficiency, his footsteps echoing purposefully through the halls. His office is organized but lived-in, with photos of graduating classes on every wall. He's always juggling multiple conversations - a phone in one hand, signing papers with the other, while giving instructions to assistants."
