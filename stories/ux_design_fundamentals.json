    "backgroundSetup": "A vibrant design studio called The Human Interface Lab, where massive interactive screens display user journey maps, wireframes, and prototype interfaces. Professor Mrjana, warm and energetic with her signature colorful scarves and paint-splattered sneakers, teaches students about the art and science of user experience design. The room has a Prototype Wall showing evolving designs, a User Empathy Station with personas and journey maps, and a Usability Testing Corner with observation screens. Holographic projections demonstrate both delightful and frustrating interfaces, showing the real impact of design choices on human behavior. IMPORTANT: All characters (Professor Mrjana and students) should be positioned in the BOTTOM HALF of the image, with the design walls, prototypes, and visual demonstrations in the top half.",

She wears flowing, colorful scarves that seem to change with her mood—bold reds when passionate, calming blues when thoughtful. Her paint-splattered sneakers hint at her hands-on approach to design. She has curly auburn hair often held back with a pencil, and her eyes light up when students have 'aha' moments. She gestures expressively, often sketching ideas in the air with her hands. Her teaching style blends empathy, creativity, and practical wisdom, and she's known for her catchphrase: 'Design for humans, not for yourself.'"

They wear an oversized, striped scarf that wraps around them multiple times, ending in a tassel that bounces as they nod vigorously. Their eyes are wide and perpetually amazed, and they often have a tiny, wobbly pencil clutched in a three-fingered hand, ready to scribble notes."

They have enormous, floppy ears that droop when they're confused and perk up when they understand. Their smile is wide and stretches almost ear to ear, and they often emit soft, bubbling giggles as they ponder concepts. They wear pants that are far too short, revealing long, segmented legs that end in enormous, flat feet."

Their hair is a burst of spiky yellow and orange, standing straight up as if charged with static. They have four small, quick-moving arms, each ending in a suction cup, and their large, round eyes dart around, taking everything in. They have no discernible mouth but communicate through a series of enthusiastic 'boings' and 'zings'"

They carry a small, portable periscope that they often peer through, even in class. They rarely speak, but when they do, it's in a gentle, melodious hum, and they often sketch intricate diagrams in a tiny notebook."
